# Jacob Mitchinson

Junior Developer and recent graduate of Makers Academy with a background in B2B digital products and wedded to Renaissance Literature. Huge fan of TDD, SOLID, agile processes, and writing clear and concise code. Previously worked with clients such as Etsy and Adidas, and proud of my final projects at Makers Academy: [MakerBot](https://github.com/jacobmitchinson/MakerBot) and [Meshee](https://github.com/jacobmitchinson/mesheeChat). I'm looking for a forward thinking company where I can take on a lot of responsibility and be able to grow and learn as a developer.

To CV readers: I always want to get better, so if you spot ways I can improve, feel welcome to drop me an email at jmitchinson@gmail.com. I strongly believe in the Agile process as an individual and in my work so feedback is important to me.  

## Skills

### Excellent Communicator (written and verbal)

- I developed my communication skills through my English degree at Goldsmiths and also during my time working at   Centaur Media working across Marketing Week, Design Week, Creative Review, Econsultancy, and Fashion Monitor as an Account Manager. 
- Successfully liaised with clients across marketing, PR, design, fashion and tech verticals culminating in some of the highest sales previously seen.
- Good at communicating how digital products work in a none technical way - learnt this whilst working for Fashion Monitor. I took fashion brands through the website, understanding their needs, and helped them deliver on their PR campaigns using our product. Also helped write the video script to explain how the site worked to none technical customers.

### Proactive Learner

- My 12 weeks at Makers Academy taught me that I'm able to quickly pick up technologies and implement them according to a brief.
- I always want to push myself to learn more. I have learnt how to use technologies that weren't on the curriculum at Makers Academy such as the mesh networking tool CJDNS (coordinating with the developers of CJDNS all over the world), implemented my own API using the Twitter API, used the Slack API to create a bot to talk with Wolfram Alpha, GitHub, and Google Calendar.
- Big fan of Javascript technologies such as Node.js, Express.js, Mocha, Chai, Webdriver.io.   
- Currently learning Angular. 
- Always looking to learn *how to learn* in a better way. 

### Creative Thinker / Creative Problem Solver / Builder

- Studied creative writing during my English degree and continue to write. 
- Musician.
- Came up with the concept for MakerBot to solve a problem we have at Makers Academy in collating resources. Came up with the concept for Meshee Chat to provide secure chat communications without the internet. 
- Love the creative process and solving real world problems by thinking laterally.

### Tenacity

- Proved this in my role as an Account Manager at Fashion Monitor in my success of attracting big clients over a long period of time. 

### Context Switching
